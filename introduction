Hello. Thanks for visiting. I'm an artist based out of Vancouver, BC,
Canada. My work includes illustrations, animation, video editing and
performance art. This web page is a new project and will evolve. For now, it
will include links to my work on other websites. Currently, I'm working as a
prepress operator in a local business and I'm keen on taking design projects on
the side. My rates are on a per-project basis. Expect to spend between three to
six hundred dollars. Contact me at oparin.aat@gmail.com for business
inquiries.
